In most AI systems, escalation is treated as a failure state. When the system cannot complete a task, it simply transfers the user to a human.

This approach creates friction and wastes context.

We redesigned escalation as a structured transition rather than a fallback.

A proper handoff now includes a full structured summary:

- what the user is trying to achieve
- what the agent has already attempted
- which tools were used and their outputs
- where uncertainty emerged
- recommended next steps for the human operator

This transforms escalation from “starting over” into “continuing execution.”

In practice, this reduces resolution time significantly. Human operators no longer need to reconstruct context from scratch. Instead, they receive a compressed execution trace.

We also introduced confidence thresholds that determine when escalation should occur. Instead of binary failure detection, the system evaluates uncertainty across multiple dimensions: semantic ambiguity, tool failure rate, and inconsistency in intermediate outputs.

The result is a smoother collaboration between agents and humans, where escalation is part of the system design rather than a breakdown of it.
