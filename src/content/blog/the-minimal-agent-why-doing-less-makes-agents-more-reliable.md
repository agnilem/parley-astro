There's a temptation, when building AI agents, to give them everything. Every tool, every permission, every possible path to a solution. It feels responsible — like you're setting them up to succeed. In practice, it's how you set them up to fail in ways you can't predict.

The most reliable agents we've seen aren't the most capable ones. They're the most constrained.

#### The Everything Agent Problem

When an agent has access to ten tools, it has to decide which one to use at every step. When it has access to three, the decision space collapses — and so does the surface area for error.
Teams building on Parley consistently report the same pattern. Agents with broad permissions tend to:

- Produce inconsistent outputs across similar inputs
- Require significantly more human oversight
- Fail in unpredictable ways that are hard to trace back to a root cause
- Erode user trust faster after a single visible mistake

The problem isn't intelligence. The problem is that complexity compounds. A small misjudgment at step one reshapes the context for step two — and by the end of a long chain, you're nowhere near where you meant to be.

#### Narrow Scope Is a Design Choice, Not a Limitation

The instinct to give agents more is understandable. More feels safer. But scope isn't a ceiling — it's a contract.

When you define exactly what an agent does and doesn't do, you make a promise to everyone who depends on it: users, teammates, the systems it touches. That promise is what makes an agent trustworthy. Not its raw capability.

Think of it like hiring a specialist versus a generalist for a critical task. The specialist doesn't need to be brilliant across every domain. They need to be deeply reliable within one.

#### Minimal vs. Maximal: A Direct Comparison

| Date | Minimal Agent | Maximum Agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tools available | 1–3, task-specific | 5+, broad access |
| Failure mode | Visible, local, fixable | Silent, cascading, hard to trace |
| Debugging time | Minutes | Hours |
| User trust after error | Recoverable | Often permanent damage |
| Ideal for | Production, critical flows | Exploration, prototyping |

#### How We Think About It at Parley

When teams come to us to design their first agent, we ask them to start with one sentence: what is the one thing this agent is responsible for?

Not three things. Not "it depends." One thing.

If the answer takes a paragraph, the scope is too wide. This agent routes incoming support requests to the right queue. This agent flags invoice discrepancies. This agent sends a follow-up 24 hours after trial start. From there, you add only what's necessary — and nothing more.

#### Less Is a Feature

The minimal agent isn't a stepping stone to something more powerful. For most tasks, it's the destination.

When you need more capability, you don't make the agent bigger. You add another agent alongside it — with its own scope, its own boundaries, its own contract. That's how you build systems that scale without becoming systems you're afraid to touch.

Do less. Do it well. That's the whole idea.
