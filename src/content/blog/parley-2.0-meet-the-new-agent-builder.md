The latest release introduces a more structured approach to building and managing agent workflows. While earlier versions focused on enabling quick setup of basic AI-driven processes, the system now supports more complex, production-oriented behavior patterns.

As usage expanded, several limitations in earlier implementations became more visible:

- workflows were difficult to debug at scale
- outputs varied across similar runs
- decision-making inside agents lacked transparency
- multi-step tasks often required fragile prompt chaining

The updated version addresses these constraints by shifting the focus from isolated prompt design to fully defined execution systems.

### From prompts to workflows

A key addition is a visual workflow engine that allows multi-step agent behavior to be explicitly defined.

Instead of relying on a single instruction block, workflows can now be structured as sequences of connected logic units. These support:

- conditional branching based on input properties
- sequential task execution with defined stages
- parallel execution paths where appropriate
- coordinated multi-agent flows within a single process

This structure makes agent behavior more predictable at the system level, even though underlying model outputs remain probabilistic.

The guiding principle is to replace implicit reasoning with explicit execution structure, where each step of the process is defined rather than inferred.

### Built-in memory as a system component

Memory handling is now integrated directly into the execution environment rather than managed externally.

It is organized into multiple layers:

- session-level memory for immediate context
- task-level memory for intermediate state
- persistent memory for long-term information retention

This enables workflows to maintain continuity across multiple steps without repeatedly reconstructing context.

Agents can now carry forward intermediate decisions, reuse structured outputs, and adjust behavior dynamically based on previously computed state.

The result is more stable behavior across long-running and multi-stage workflows.

### Execution visibility and debugging

Another major enhancement is full visibility into agent execution.

Each run can be inspected as a structured sequence of events, including:

- step-by-step execution flow
- model selection at each stage
- tool usage and external calls
- intermediate outputs
- decision points and failure locations

This makes it possible to trace system behavior precisely rather than relying on final output inspection.

In practice, this reduces debugging time and improves reliability in complex workflows where multiple components interact.

### Model and tool orchestration

The system is designed to operate across multiple models and tools rather than relying on a single execution engine.

Each step in a workflow can dynamically select the most appropriate resource:

- smaller models for classification and routing tasks
- mid-tier models for structured reasoning and transformation
- larger models for synthesis and complex generation tasks

External tools can also be integrated into workflows, allowing agents to interact with APIs, databases, and internal services as part of execution.

This creates a modular system where different components specialize in different parts of the process, rather than overloading a single model with all responsibilities.

### From conversational agents to execution systems

The most important shift in this release is conceptual.

Instead of treating agents as conversational interfaces, they are now treated as structured execution systems with defined state and behavior.

Each agent:

- maintains internal state across steps
- follows explicit execution logic
- interacts with tools as part of a workflow
- produces outputs that can be inspected and evaluated

This allows agent behavior to be designed, tested, and refined at the system level rather than depending solely on prompt quality.

### Summary

This update moves agent development toward a more structured and controllable paradigm.

The focus shifts from crafting effective prompts to designing reliable execution systems, where workflows, memory, and orchestration define behavior more than individual model responses.

The result is a system that is easier to reason about, scale, and improve over time.
